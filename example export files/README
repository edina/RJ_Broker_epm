This package includes 4 sample files which show the range of metadata that the Repository Junction Broker can export:

323.zip: a EuropePMC record with good funder & grant-code information
337.zip: My test record for Repnet. Interesting because one of the documents contains 4 files... and there is embargo information as well
427.zip: a record from nature that has embargoed records, exported to someone who has not signed up to accept enbargoed data - the existence of the files is given, but the files themselves are not
467.zip: A EuropePMC record with multiple URLs to off-site full-text copies

To test deposits into your repository, you can use the cURL program:
